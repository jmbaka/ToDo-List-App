## To-do List Assignment

### Create a simple todo list that has the following functionalities:
* You can add a new item to the todo list (required)
* You can remove an item from the todo list (required)
* You can edit an item in the todo list (optional)

### Some further requirements:
* the input field must be reset when the add button is clicked on 
* prevent empty values from being added to the list
* the todo list must show the most recently added item first on the list
* the todo list should be stored using localStorage (see helpful resources below). So, when the page is reloaded, any item in the todo list will still be displayed on the web page.

### Submit the following:
* A link to the GitHub repository containing your solution 
* A link to your solution hosted on Netlify or Github pages
